# Intro to RDS
- What is RDS: managed relational database service
- PaaS offering making it easier to scale and setup databases

## Types of database engines that RDS supports
- Commercial engines: Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server
- Open Source engines: MariaDB, Postgres, MySQL
- Cloud native engine: Aurora (postgres / mysql compatible)

## Benefits
- RDS aims to lower TCO (total cost of owners)

## Self hosted vs RDS
- IaaS --> creating everything from scratch
- PaaS --> Create database, load data and tune queries 

## Configurations of RDS
- DB engine
- License model
- DB Engine version
- Instance class
- Multi AZ Deployment 
- Storage type and size
- Backups
- Monitoring and maintenance
- Does NOT allow shell access to the database instance


## Terminology
- Database instance: isolated database in the cloud
- DB engine type: DB type you want to run (pgsql, mysql etc)
- DB instance class: CPU + memory capacity of DB instance
- Multi AZ: Fault tolerance / high availability
- Read replica: A node a part of the db instance that only reads queries (burdens load from master)
- Primary host: node within DB that handles the read / write traffic of the db
- Secondary host: the backup of primary incase of failover
- Aurora: cloud native engine that aws created for pgsql and mysql
